# Welcome to the Manchester Baby Project ðŸ‘‹

The Manchester Baby project consists of a Simulator of the Manchester SSEM (also known as the Manchester Baby), as well as an assembler for SSEM Assembly code. Both parts have been modified to work with larger memory stores, which can be increased to up to 4096 memory locations. Furthermore, the addition of immediate addressing is planned.

## Simulator
### Usage
To compile the executable using the g++ compiler, you can make use of our ```makefile```. Simply run: 
```sh
make
```
If you are using a different compiler, you can edit the corresponsing variables in the ```makefile```.

To run the program, simply run your executable (default name is ```outfile```) and follow the on-screen instructions.
## Assembler
